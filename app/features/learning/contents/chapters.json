  "title": "My First Day at the Dormitory ",
  "description": "Mina stood at the threshold of her dorm room, a single suitcase in one hand and a tote bag slung over her shoulder. The hallway buzzed with excitement—doors slamming, laughter echoing, parents giving last-minute advice. Her roommate hadn’t arrived yet, so the room felt eerily quiet, just two beds, two desks, and a view of the campus courtyard below.\n\nShe unpacked slowly, pinning up a few photos and unfolding her blanket, trying to make the space feel like her own. That night, after awkward introductions with her floor mates and a group dinner in the dining hall.",
